title: Image alt attribute
---

* Alt text describes the content of the image and provices a text-alternative.
* Good `alt` text is short but descriptive, and meant to briefly convey the meaning of the image.
* For images, screen readers can access the `alt` attribute and read its contents to deliver key information.
* Per HTML5 specification, this is now considered mandatory.
* `alt`  can be set to an empty string when images are grouped with a caption already describing them, or are used for decoration only.

```html
<img src="visualDecoration.jpeg" alt="">
```
